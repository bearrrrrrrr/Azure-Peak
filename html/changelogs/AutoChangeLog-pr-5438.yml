  - rscadd: "Added two new deities to the Gronnic Pantheon's flag. Gronnites can now mechanically worship region-specific versions of Abyssor (as the Spiraling Kraken) and Dendor (as the Volfskinned Man)."
  - rscadd: "Talismans, made by 7Sin! All Gronnic roles now spawn with a special amulet that provides a crash course on the region-specific version of their chosen patron. Heed them well, lest you face scrutiny from your countrymen."
