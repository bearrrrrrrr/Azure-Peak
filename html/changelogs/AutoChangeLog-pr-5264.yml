  - rscadd: "The Equestrian virtue has now been replaced with Saddleborn, which allows you to pick your mount, send it away, and summon it back with a whistle. Nobles can pick horses."
  - rscadd: "You incur a massive mood penalty for the entire round if your mount dies."
  - rscadd: "Mounted Knights, Cavalry MAAs, and the Knight Captain get Saddleborn by default."
  - balance: "Toggling a mount between sprinting and not sprinting has a shorter wait time based on your riding skill."
  - balance: "Saiga does now have as much health, and do as much damage as saiga bucks."
